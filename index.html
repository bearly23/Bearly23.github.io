                    <h3>Personal</h3>
                        <p> My name is Ashton Sidebottom. I am a wine enthusiast from the Pacific Northwest. My passion for wine started with a shot in the dark when determining what to study in college. I have always been interested in science and plants, so I took a chance and enrolled in a viticulture and enology program. After my first courses and vineyard visits, I was hooked. Since then my passion for wine has only grown.</p>
                            
                        <p>When I am not drinking or making wine, I am smoking meat or baking, traveling with my wife, exploring the PNW with our two dogs, or working on a new tech project. My wife and I's adventures take us all over the West Coast, and we are always looking forward to our next trip.</p>

                <div class="about proffesional">
                    <h3>Proffesional</h3>
                    <p>My proffessional journey started at Washington State University, where I studied Viticulture and Enology. This degree in short is wine-grape growing and the science behind wine making. Being a school in Washington State, most of our focus was on the Washington wine industry. During this time I interned at a local brewery, Paradise Creek Brewery, where I learned the basics of beer production and equipment used in breweries.</p>
                    
                    <p>After graduating, I worked with Heritage Distilling helping them bottle hand sanitizer to be distributed throughout the US during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. This only lasted a few months before I started with Novelty Hill - Januik winery as an intern for the harvest of 2020.</p>

                    <p>As a Harvest Intern, I worked in the cellar helping with the winemaking process. Which is mostly cleaning equipment, setting up transfer hoses, filling barrels. After harvest, I transitioned to a Cellar Hand position where I worked for a year before being promoted to Enologist. In this position I was responsible for running analysis on juice, fermentations, and wines as well as determining additions to be made and carrying out those additions. More about these processes can be found on the Wine page.</p>
